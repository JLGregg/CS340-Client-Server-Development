# CS340-Client-Server-Development


    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
      The program I wrote utilizes functions that can easily used for CRUD, or create, read, update, and delete. I stored the program in a .py file for use in Jupyter Notebook that can easily be imported to use within any project. The advantage of doing this is to save the time needed to rewrite the functions. Since it can be easily implemented, there is no need to write the code again. Just import the file.
      
      
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
      I like to start with easier tasks first. The reason I like to do this is, as an example, Ithe read_all function, which I created and this allowed me to make sure my code was working when importing the database before trying to filter through the database. After I had this working, I then tried to read one of the items and then worked on creating and deleting. In the future, I will probably do the same thing as I did on the project, create the easier taks first and make sure what I am writing is working with the database and then move on to the harder tasks.
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
      Computer Scientists use collected data to make predictive models that can then be used to forecast. They can use machine learning techniques, tools such as Python, R, etc. My work on this project would help to give the team a reusable code for the CRUD methods and use the work I did within dash to help visualize the data.
